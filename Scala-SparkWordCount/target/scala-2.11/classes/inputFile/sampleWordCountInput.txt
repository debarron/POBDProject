project/Versions.scala -> val Spark = "1.4.0" -> "1.4.1".

Although it is actually a mystery to me why it did help :).

EDIT:

On the second thought i've noticed by accident, that the file spark-core_2.11-1.4.0.jar was broken (each time it was downloaded by sbt).

It also helped to replacing .jar with valid one from:

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.11/1.4.0

I suppose it is somehow connected with spark-cassandra-connector build system or repo from which file is downloaded.

Maybe we should file an issue.

EDIT2:

i found out, that broken .jar comes from (at least in my case):

https://jcenter.bintray.com/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.11/1.4.0/spark-core_2.11-1.4.0.jar

you can see its origin in: .ivy2/cache/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.11/ivydata-1.4.0.properties

i did not manage to find out why it comes from jcenter (https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). maybe it is somehow connected with adding bintray repo to my linux mint or new version of sbt or datastax uses bintray. i will probably investigate later.
